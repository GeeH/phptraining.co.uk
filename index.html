                <p>This two-day course uses interactive coding to introduce and then looks in detail at Zend Expressive 2.
                    We start by looking at the foundations of the framework and then turn our attention to how
                    middleware works and provides the power and flexibility in Expressive. You will learn how to build a
                    well-rounded website using the rich eco-system of components from Zend Framework and elsewhere with
                    Composer integration.</p>

                    <p>This two-day course has hands-on exercises to introduce API building with PHP. We start by
                        looking at HTTP and how APIs work and then turn our attention to building one out in PHP. You'll
                        leave with a solid understanding of API theory, and you're own API built using what you've
                        learned.</p>

                        Zend Framework 3. We start by looking at the foundations of the framework and then turn our
                        attention to new modular-based MVC application system to provide attendees with a good
                        understanding of Zend Framework. We also look at some of the other components within ZF that
